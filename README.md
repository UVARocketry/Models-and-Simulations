# Models-and-Simulations
Engine modeling code and files for CFD, FEA, and other simulations. Ansys workbench files are .wbpj

The 2D-Steady State folder has the whole Ansys workbook for that sim. Inside there is a Results folder with images, annotations, and excel files of the results that can be opened without Ansys products.
