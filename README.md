# Models-and-Simulations
Engine modeling code and results files/images/data. Ansys workbench files are .wbpj.

The 2D-Steady State Results folder has results from a 4000-iteration, axisymmetric, steady-state simulation of the engine that was done in Fluent. The results are in pictures, annotations, graphs, and processed values in Excel files, so no Ansys products are required to open them. The whole simulation folder is too big for here so it's uploaded as a zip on the google drive.
